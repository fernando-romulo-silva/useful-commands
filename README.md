# About
This is a set of Linux useful terminal programs that help the author in his work life.
It's not an executable project, just a place to reminder "how to do".
I separate it into folders:

## dockers-and-cia

Basics docker, docker-compose, kubernets, and minikube terminal commands help deal with dockers; I prefer to use the [docstation](https://github.com/DockStation/dockstation), but if I can't, It may help.

## internet

Some useful terminal commands helping to deal with the internet. 

## multimida

Ripping, extract audio, converting videos, and audios, etc. A lot of stuff for multimedia things. Thanks [ffmpeg] (https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg)!

## utils

Commands that help me on servers, like tail logs, start wildfly servers, process id, etc.
